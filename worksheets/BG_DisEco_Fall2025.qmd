Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection\
\
1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

n= 59

\
2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

n= 299

\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

n= 229

The sample size requirement of a) is larger than that of b)

\
3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%. (5 points)

95% confident the prevalence is \< 1%
