Worksheet 3: Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)

06/12/25

New cases: 5

Susceptible: 56-1-4 = 51

Incidence = 5/51= 0.098 = 9.8% per day

06/14/25

New cases: 2

Susceptible: 56-12= 44

Incidence = 2/44 = 0.0455 = 4.6% per day

06/15/25

New Cases: 0

Susceptible: 56-14 = 42

Incidence: 0/42 = 0% per day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence. (5 points)

06/13/25: 12 ill

12/56 = 0.214 = 21.4 %

06/16/25: 5 ill

5/56 = 0.089 = 8.9%

The unit for incidence is % of the population at a specific point in time

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)

On 06/10/25

Prevalence = 1/56 = 17.9 %

Incidence = 1/56 = 17.9%

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest? (3 points)

Incidence is the lowest on 06/15/25 and 06/16/25 because there are no new cases.

Disease Ecology Midterm 

**1**. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect                                     (**12 points**). (Used various lectures) 

a\. Compared to macroparasites, microparasites have a shorter generation time and do not reproduce within the host.

**False.** Microparisites do reproduce within the hosts. Macroparasites generally do not multiply within a single host. 

b\. Using disease models, we can make accurate predictions of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population. 

**False.** Models can give scenarios and ranges but real world scenarios have different uncertain factors and errors. Disease models can be helpful for predictions but they are not always reliable and accurate. 

c\. Chagas disease is a protozoal disease that is commonly transmitted by the triatomine bug (Kissing bug). It can also be transmitted by consumption of contaminated food or beverages (feces of infected triatomine bugs). Chagas disease is therefore a contagious disease.

**False.** Chagas is not contagious because it does not have routine person-to-person spread. Transmission is primarily from the bug itself or oral contamination. 

d\. Epizootic Hemorrhagic disease always causes severe outbreaks in white-trailed deer populations across the US, resulting in high mortalities. 

**False.** EDH varies by place/time. Outbreaks are not always severe. They can be mild or localized also. For example, in the south such as Florida, there are high infection rates annually, but clinical disease is rarely reported. There can also be chronic forms of the disease shown, but low mortality rates. 

e\. White-tailed deer infected with brain worm (*Parelophostrongylus tenuis*) rarely exhibit any symptoms or clinical signs. But infected white-tailed deer pass infectious larvae through their feces. White-tailed deer with brain worms can therefore be described as infected, diseased and infectious. 

**False.** Because white-tailed deer are typically asymptomatic hosts, they are infected and infectious but not usually diseased. 

f\. The deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) infected with Sin Nombre Virus  do not show any clinical signs, but excrete the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. Humans get infected via aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent. The illness caused by Sin Nombre virus in humans is called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS is therefore a vector-transmitted disease.

**False.** It is not a vector transmitted disease because that describes being bitten, there is no vector involved. HPS is acquired by inhalation. 

 

2\. Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and  incidence.                                                                                                                                                 (**5 points**) 

**Prevalence:** This is the number of affected as a proportion of the total population. It is calculated by: #infected/ #N. This is a calculation of how many animals have the disease at a point in time. 

**Incidence:** This is a measure of risk. Includes **only** new cases of disease. It is calculated by the number of new cases divided by the animals at risk of developing the disease.

 4. Moose can get infected by consuming a gastropod infected with *Parelaphostrongylus tenuis* larvae. Infected moose exhibit clinical signs like weakness, incoordination, circling, paralysis, and eventual death. But moose are unable to propagate the parasite. Such hosts are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.                                                          (**2 points**)

5. 

a\) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Measles. Average infectious period for measles is 8 days.                                                                       (**2 points**) 

 γ = 1/8 = **0.125 day \^-1**

b) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Rotavirus. Average infectious period for Rotavirus is1-3 weeks, average of 2 weeks.                                    (**2 points**) 

 

γ = 1/14 = **0.0714 day \^-1**

c\) The R~0~ for measles is estimated at 15 and 17 for rotavirus. Calculate β for both diseases.                                                                                                                                                (**2 points**) 

Measles β= 15 x 0.125= **1.875 day\^-1**

Rotavirus β= 17 x 0.0714= **1.2143 day -1**

d\) Calculate R~eff~ for a measles outbreak in a population with 80% measles vaccination coverage.                                                                                                                                                (**3 points**) 

R~eff~ = 15 x 0.20 = **3**

6\. For any transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible? (**6 points**)

1.  Infected but not diseased

2.  Infected and diseased

3.  Not infected but diseased

For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is *not possible*, justify why with clear reasoning.

1.  Infected but not diseased **Possible:** Hosts are capable of carrying a pathogen without clinical signs. They could still be able to transmit the pathogen. Example: White tailed deer with brain worm. These Deer are infected with the pathogen, but rarely show any clinical signs.  

2.  Infected and diseased **Possible:** Pathogen is present and causes symptoms present in the host. Example: Deer with EHD. They experience lesions and possibly mortality.  

3.  Not infected but diseased **Not Possible:** This is not possible because in order to be diseased, the pathogen must be present to first infect you. There is no disease without infection. 

4.  

7\. Estimate the incubation period for Campylobacteriosis and Norovirus gastroenteritis from the following Epidemic curves.                                                                                (**4 points**)

     

Campylobacteriosis: **3-4 days**

Norovirus gastroenteritis: **1-2 days**

(Lecture 5)

8\. In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.                                                                                       (**20 points**)

The proximate cause was **acute hemorrhage septicemia**. This is a bacterial disease that had been already known and prominent in cattle. It is caused by a bacteria called *Pasteurella multocida.* This pathogen is always present in the nasal cavity. The disease occurs when the animals are stressed and all close together in the heat. In these conditions, the pathogen becomes active. At first, it was not clear what caused the casualties of so many antelope at once. Scientists discovered that there was unusually high humidity at the time of the deaths and females were clustered together giving birth which created stress. 

Because it is a commonsal pathogen, controlling the pathogen is not a possible strategy. Vaccination is also not a possible strategy. The climate is also not a controllable variable. However because the female Saiga antelopes give birth to two calfs at a time, they are able to bounce back at a fast rate. One thing that can be done is preventing poaching and other threats to the population. 

(Lecture 2) 

9\. In his 1933 book *Game Management*, Aldo Leopold dedicated a chapter to wildlife diseases, stating that wildlife disease is primarily an ecological issue driven largely by human actions. Do you agree with this perspective? Explain your reasoning, using at least two examples from wildlife disease systems to support your answer.                   (**6 points**)

**Yes, I agree with this perspective.** Human actions can cause stress and movement between animal populations causing disease to spread. One example of this is white-nose syndrome in bats. This disease is believed to have been introduced by humans in general. Also, the spread of this disease can be amplified by cave visitation from humans which can cause bats to cluster. Another example is CWD in deer. This disease has been worsened by human management such as artificial feeding, captive breeding, and translocation of animals. 

10\. Define R~0~. Estimate R~0~ for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents an infectious case, and blue are susceptibles; an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of R~0~. (**10 points**)    

**R~0~ is the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population.**

Scenario:

                       R~0~ =  1/1= **1**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

            R~0~ = 3/1= **3**

            

------------------------------------------------------------------------

            R~0~ = 2/1= **2**

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  R~0~ = 0/1= **0**

Scenario 1:  R~0~ = 1, this means that the disease is stable 

Scenario 2:  R~0~ \> 1, this means the disease is an expanding epidemic, it will continue to spread 

Scenario 3: R~0~ \> 1, this means the disease is an expanding epidemic, it will continue to spread 

Scenario 4: R~0~ \< 1, this means that the disease is dying out, it will eventually fade

11\. Steve studies a population of the Suwannee Alligator Snapping turtle (*Macrochelys suwanniensis*) in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010.  Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data was collected by Steve:

|  | 2019 |  | 136 |  | 4 |  | 2 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Turtles without visible fibroma are considered susceptible to the disease. 

a) Which year has the highest incidence of turtle fibroma? Make sure you write appropriate unit for the incidence value.  Show your work.                                                 (**5 points**) 

2015: 4 / (133−0) = **0.0301 = 3.01%/yr**

2016: 5 / (125−2) = **0.0407 = 4.07%/yr**

2017: 8 / (112−4) = **0.0741 = 7.41%/yr**

2018: 4 / (145−5) = **0.0286 = 2.86%/yr**

2019: 2 / (136−4) = **0.0152 = 1.52%/yr**

**The highest incidence is 2017 at 7.41% per year**

b) When is the prevalence lowest? When is the prevalence highest? Write unit for prevalence if applicable.                                                                                                                   (**5 points**) 

2015: (0+4)/133 = **3.01%**

2016: (2+5)/125 = **5.60%**

2017: (4+8)/112 = **10.71%**

2018: (5+4)/145 = **6.21%**

2019: (4+2)/136 = **4.41%**

**The lowest prevalence: 2015 at 3.01%**

**The highest prevalence: 2017 at 10.71%**

(Lecture 4) 

12\. The Dutch harbor seal population is estimated to be around 5400 with \~50% adults. Seals are susceptible to phocine distemper virus (PDV), but an estimated 40% of the adults in this population are immune to PDV by virtue of prior natural infection. How many seals in this population should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity sufficient to prevent an outbreak of PDV in this population if the R0 is estimated to be \~3? Assume that all the adult seals that have survived prior PDV infection are tagged, and hence identifiable.                                                                                                                                              (**10 points**) 

Adult seals susceptible = 5400/2 =2,700 

48% of adults already immune- 1,080 immune 

R0 \~ 3 = heard immunity 2/3 

Target immune count= 5400 x 2/3 = 3,600

Worksheet 4: Multihost pathogens, Spillover\
\
\
MERS-CoV\
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels\
(dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to\
humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has\
resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause\
severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.\
Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April\
2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)\

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If incorrect, provide\
an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (3 points)

    Inccorect. MERS-CoV is maintained in camels, not in humans. Although humans are spillover hosts, they are not the primary host where the disease is maintained.

<!-- -->

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (3 points)

    Correct.

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (3 points)

    Incorrect. Although humans are not the primary host, they are able to transfer the disease from one human to another in close contact. Because transmission can occur, humans are not dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately\
    65%. (3 points)

    Incorrect. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV is 35%.

5.  The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak. (3 points)

    Incorrect. The curve shows many different points of outbreak. There is not one single point source.

6.  Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this\
    decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral\
    factors that may have contributed to this trend. (5 points)

It could be possible for many different reasons. Ecologically, there could be increasing immunity among the camels which has reduced the amount of camels that will spread the disease to humans. Epidemiologically, there have been many different improved diagnostic forms that have evolved in recent years. Also, because of the COVID-19 outbreak, hospitals began learning more about containing illnesses and preventing the transmission to other human hosts. The pandemic also reduced travel, so there were fewer people traveling that could have potentially contracted the disease and fewer tourists coming in contact with camels. Behaviorally, transmission would be lowered due to social distancing during the pandemic and increased hygiene such as hand washing and mask wearing. It could also be possible that minimizing contact with camels in general has decreased the spread of MERS-CoV. All together, these are possible ways that there has been such a decline in cases.

Worksheet 5: Community Epidemiology Framework\
\
\
Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024\
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda\
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit\
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of\
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health\
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

\
1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,\
would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging\
infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

I would classify the Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event. This is an example of possible outcome number 2 of a spillover where the pathogen invades H2 and can be transmitted but cannot be sustained. This is because the disease comes from a crossover between zoonotic diseases and humans. The Marburg virus was transmitted to humans through infected bats. Because the disease has been contained and mostly infected those who worked in healthcare I do not believe that it can be classified as an emerging infectious disease. If prevention measures are successfully practiced, the disease will not spread any more.

\
2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both\
community and healthcare settings? 5 points

\
In the community, it is important that people report any symptoms they are feeling and anyone they came in contact with to prevent transmission. It is also important that people know how to prevent spreading the disease themselves so they can take preventative measures.

In healthcare settings, it is important that clinical trials be done to find out how to treat the disease successfully. It is also important that healthcare workers follow specific guidelines to prevent the disease from spreading to themselves and others.

Together these practices can help to reduce the transmission of diseases to the community.

Worksheet 7

**Nipah Virus**\
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
measures recommended in each setting. 8 points

Malaysia:

In Malaysia, the transmission to humans occurred from pigs. The disease was first noticed in 1998 in farmers who worked closely to pigs. The disease did first come from bats, but pigs caused the virus to amplify and spread to humans, although there was minimal human to human transmission.

Bangladesh:

In Bangladesh, there was a different mode of transmission. Date palm sap collection is a very big practice in Bangladesh. They use pots to collect the sap. The transmission occurred directly from bats to humans, through the pots that were used to collect date palm sap. If bat saliva, urine, feces, or other bodily fluids ended up in the sap, humans could ingest it leading to them contracting the disease. In this case, human to human transmission was more common.

Preventative:

In Malaysia, preventative measures should focus on livestock control. There should be practices put in place to prevent bat and pig interactions that could help the pigs to not contract the disease and spread it to humans. In Bangladesh, the focus should be on preventing bats from accessing the date palm sap. This could be done by covering the pots. Also preventing people from consuming raw sap. There should also be prevention in healthcare settings to prevent it from spreading more in both places.

\
**Avian Reovirus**\
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
its impact on the affected population. 6 points

Transmission routes:

Can be transmitted through vertical or horizontal transmission. Vertical transmission occurs when an infected bird transfers the disease directly into the baby through egg contamination. Horizontal transmission occurs through a fecal-oral route. The environment of overcrowding, poor sanitation, and contaminated food or water sources cause these transmission routes to occur.

Pathogen characteristics:

High temperatures and humidity allow for the pathogen to persist in the environment, allowing for horizontal transmission though fecal-oral transfer. The virus is able to survive long enough to infect new hosts.

Example:

An example of a wild bird disease could be in flocks of birds that travel together and live in close habitats. If one bird is infected, it would be very easy for the entire flock to develop the disease. An example of this is crows especially in the winter months. They can develop a disease called winter mortality that is caused by ARV. Severe inflammation is caused and eventually death.

\
**Langya henipavirus**\
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? 6 points

The likely reservoir host for LayV is shrews. Humans are believed to become infected through zoonotic transmission through direct or indirect contact with infected shrews or other animals through bodily fluids. Most cases occurred in people who were frequently exposed to wild animals. This disease is considered a spillover because there was no evidence of human to human spread. There were a few rare cases of the disease in humans that were localized. There have been no proved cases since 2021, proving that it is a spillover disease. If it was a potential EID, the disease would be sustained in the population.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worksheet 8

I first decided to look at patterns between the different regions. These were the calculations at 95% confidence:

**North:**

Prevalence: 28.6%

Lower CL: 17%

Upper CL: 42.8%

**South:**

Prevalence: 62.8%

Lower CL: 44.7%

Upper CL: 75.9%

**Central**

Prevalence: 64.3%

Lower CL: 37.1%

Upper CL: 84.7%

p-value0.0016

This data shows that the prevalence of *B. procyonis* is very low in the north compared in central and southern regions. This could be due to environmental factros such as temperature. It is interesting that the central region has the highest prevalence. The p value shows that these results are significant because it is less than 0.05.

I also wanted to compare prevalence between male and female raccoons in general to see if there were any patterns:

**Female:**

Prevalence: 64.9%

Lower CL: 48.6%

Upper CL: 78.6%

**Male**

Prevalence: 37.7%

Lower CL: 26.7%

Upper CL: 50%

P value: 0.0087

These results show that the disease is more prevalent in females than in males which is interesting. This means that females are more at risk for contracting the bacteria. The P value also shows that it is significant because it is less than .05. This could be due to behavioral differences in the females compared to males. Females are also closer to their offspring, which could lead to a higher chance of contracting the disease.

I also compared prevalence between male and female in each region to see if they were similar to the trend that was seen in the general male and female results:

**North**

Female:

Prevalence: 38.1%

Lower CL: 19.7%

Upper CL: 59.7%

Male:

Prevalence: 21.4%

Lower CL: 9.8%

Upper CL: 40.9%

**South**

Female:

Prevalence: 100%

Lower CL: 73.6%

Upper CL: 100%

Male:

Prevalence: 50%

Lower CL: 32.6%

Upper CL: 67.4%

**Central**

Female:

Prevalence: 100%

Lower CL: 50%

Upper CL: 100%

Male:

Prevalence: 44.4%

Lower CL: 16.9%

Upper CL: 74.9%

These results show that there is a similar trend between male and females between regions as there is generally between males and females. In all regions, the females have a higher prevalence than the male raccoons. The south and central region females both have 100% prevalence which is very interesting and further supports the idea that females are more likely to be infected.

I compared adults and young adults in general:

Adults:

Prevalence: 51.5%

Lowe CL: 39.7%

Upper CL: 63.3%

Young Adults:

Prevalence: 37.8%

Lowe CL: 23.4%

Upper CL: 54.1%

P-value: 0.2212

These results show that the bacteria is more common in adults than it is in young adults. This could be due to the further development of adults compared to young adults. The p-value is \> than 0.05 which means that these results are not statistically significant.

Next I compared adults and young adults by different regions:

**North** 

Adult: 

Prevalence: 28%

Lower CL: 13.4%

Upper CL: 48%\

Young Adult: 

Prevalence: 29.2%

Lower CL: 13.9%

Upper CL:  50%

**South** 

Adult: 

Prevalence: 67.7%

Lower CL: 50%

Upper CL: 82.9%

\
Young Adult: 

Prevalence: 50%

Lower CL: 24.3%

Upper CL:  75.7%

**Central:** 

Adult: 

Prevalence: 61.5%

Lower CL: 34.2%

Upper CL: 83.4%

Young Adult: 

Prevalence: 100%

Lower CL: 5%

Upper CL:  100%

\
These results share a different finding than the general adult vs young adult results. In the north and central regions, the young adults actually have a higher prevalence. In central, there was only one young adult tested which lead to the 100% prevalence. My thought is that if more young adults had been studied, there would be a lower prevalence number. It makes sense that the p-value tells us that these results are not significant.\

**Re:**       Marburg Virus Disease: Public Health Assessment and Recommendations 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Introduction**

This memo provides insight into Marburg virus disease (MVD).  I will provide an overview of the disease including its clinical presentation, transmission routes, natural reservoir, and geographical distribution. My aim is to inform you of the potential risks that could occur if MVD were to travel to the United States and to present ideas for a response to an outbreak of MVD.

\

**Overview of Marburg Virus Disease and Symptoms**

Orthomarburgvirus marburgense is a species of virus that includes Marburg virus and Ravn virus, the true causes of MVD (WHO, 2025).  The disease first manifests in humans through contact with Rousettus fruit bats. Though outbreak of the disease is rare, it can lead to serious illness. Some symptoms of MVD include: 

-   Fever

-   Headache 

-   Rash 

-   Nausea and Vomiting 

-   Hemorrhaging 

-   Liver Failure

The illness has an incubation period of 2-21 days after the host is infected (CDC, 2025). Symptoms do tend to present very quickly and death can occur rapidly, with most patients passing between 8 and 9 days after symptoms begin. 

\

**Transmission and Spillover Pathways**

Transmission of MVD originally occurs through zoonotic transmission from Rousettus fruit bats to humans. This most frequently occurs from exposure in mines and caves that the fruit bats inhabit, as the bats are the primary reservoir host (Cleveland Clinic).  Humans can become infected through coming into direct contact with the infected bat, their bodily fluids, or even just prolonged exposure. After this initial transmission from animal to human, human to human transmission is also possible. This transmission can occur from direct contact such as bodily fluids and also from indirect contact such as contaminated surfaces. Humans are only able to transmit the disease once symptoms are present. 

\

A spillover event refers to the transmission of a disease from one species to another. Outbreaks of MVD can be referred to as a spillover event, because usually the outbreak is not sustained for an extended period of time in the human population. However, in order to keep it from being sustained, healthcare professionals and the public should know about MVD and ways to prevent the spread. 

\

**Geographical Distribution and Risks to the United States**

Although MVD outbreaks occur most often overseas in countries in Africa, it is possible for the disease to spread to the United States which is a non-endemic region. The fruit bats that carry the disease are not found in the United States, they are found in other countries such as Africa which is why it is more common for an outbreak to begin there. However, with travel the spread could come from human hosts.\
\

According to the World Health Organization as of November 14, 2025 there is a current outbreak of MVD in Ethiopia. The page was last updated on November 21, 2025 and there are currently 6 confirmed cases with three patients who have already died. (WHO, 2025)  With travel so common, and an incubation period of 2-21 days, MVD could potentially have an outbreak here, especially if someone who came in contact with a confirmed case traveled. If this were to occur, it is important that healthcare officials and the public are aware of the symptoms of the disease so its spread can be contained. 

\

Because the early symptoms of MVD present similarly to other diseases, it is important that tests are done such as ELISA and RT-PCR so the disease can be correctly diagnosed (WHO, 2025).  Although there is not a current outbreak of the disease in the United States, it should still be brought to your attention in case there is an unlikely spread. 

\

**Recommended Response Strategies**

I would like to suggest some response strategies that should be implemented if MVD ever does make its way to the United States.  Once someone is diagnosed with the disease, it is first crucial that anyone who previously came in contact with the patient be monitored because it is likely that they too will have become infected. The public should be made aware that the disease is in the area and take preventative measures themselves to keep safe from MVD spread. The community should also be aware of the symptoms so if they are infected they can receive medical care. 

\

Because human to human transmission is typically limited to close contact, most MVD outbreaks do die out unless healthcare spread occurs.  In the healthcare setting, workers should take extra precautions when treating a MVD patient. If they come in contact with any bodily fluid including blood and saliva they will also become ill. In past outbreaks, it is common for most of the infected to be healthcare professionals because of their close contact to the patient. It is important that precautions are put in place to stop the spread of the disease, and to keep those who work in healthcare safe from contracting the disease themselves. Facilities should have isolation rooms and PPE such as gowns, gloves, face shields, and proper waste disposal. 

**Prevention and Preparedness**

Because Florida is a frequent tourist state and there is a small outbreak occurring right now, it is important that preventative steps are taken to limit the exposure that could occur. Healthcare professionals should constantly be updated on what to do if there is a case of MVD or another highly infectious disease. Staff should be familiar with what protective equipment is essential for cases like this and how to protect themselves and others from promoting the spread of MVD. There should be screening done on travel to assure that no one is able to enter the United States if they have symptoms, or have come in contact with someone who has symptoms. 

\

**Conclusion** 

Although MVD is rare, its ability to spread rapidly in healthcare settings is a cause for concern. By improving surveillance, preparing hospitals and healthcare workers, and monitoring outbreaks Florida and the United States as a whole will be ready should the disease travel here. Early recognition of the disease by observing symptoms and running diagnostics is essential for keeping our community safe. I hope that you consider my response strategies and that this message has been insightful.

Worksheet 9

1\. In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in\
the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic\
spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard\
poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain\
why these behaviors facilitated human infection. 10 points

One example of this is having children present in the home. If there are children constantly cuddling or playing with the birds, there is a high risk that they could become infected with the disease. It is important that if you have backyard poultry and children you limit the contact that your children have with the birds or they could develop salmonella or other diseases. 

Another example of this is poor disinfectant practices. In commercial poultry, they are able to identify and prevent disease spread rapidly and also keep things such as soil and water supplies from becoming contaminated. They also usually vaccinate the poultry. This does not occur in backyard poultry. It is likely that disease could be spread through the soil because the owners are not aware of how to correctly disinfect or control disease. Humans can come in contact with this soil or water and then contract the disease. 

Another practice is the eggs that the poultry produce. This is usually why people have backyard poultry. If humans come in contact with the eggs without properly sanitizing them they can contract salmonella. It is important that proper sanitary measures are in place but that is not always the case. 

\
2. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë\
coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in\
grazing livestock.

\
a. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal\
endophyte? 3 points

Some advantages that tall fescue gained was increased tolerance to environmental stress like droughts and the ability to outcompete other species because of its tolerance to overgrazing. 

\
b. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of\
fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 4 points

Some factors include temperature and drought stress, soil fertility, microbial communities, and grazing management. 

\
c. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 3 points

The key clinical signs include excessive weight loss, rough and discolored hair coats, and poor performance.

Worksheet 10 

1\. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do\
humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 10 points

There are several different routes of transmission of ASF. The first is through the vector borne ticks. These ticks are able to spread the disease through the pigs as they take blood from infected hosts and transfer it to other pigs. The disease can also transmit directly from pig to pig though bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, and feces. Indirect contact also plays a role as feed, transport equipment, and even clothes can allow for the transmission of the disease. Humans can act as mechanical vectors by transporting the disease via clothing or equipment to other farms or other pigs, however they are not biological hosts. 

\

\
2. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,\
progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. 10 points

Co-infection of koalas with KoRV and chlamydia has several effects. KoRV is a virus that acts similarly to HIV in humans. It suppresses the immune system in koalas and allows for chlamydia to present with even worse symptoms and be more prevalent. The co-infection of KoRV and chlamydia in koalas causes higher mortality and infertility rates. 

\

\
3. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging\
threat to wild snake populations in North America.\
What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of\
Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? 10 points

The key challenges of SFD include the fact that snake fungal disease is often difficult to control in the environment. The fungus is able to survive in soil which makes it hard to get rid of it especially because that is where snakes move and inhabit. There are also diagnostic challenges that occur which cause poor surveillance of SFD. The qPCR used to diagnose snakes with SFD can often give false negatives. These challenges allow for the persistence of SFD in the environment and throughout snake populations.
